INTRODUCTION

Welcome to FastTrack Rides ("the App"), provided by FastTrack Rides, Inc. ("the Company," "we," "our," or "us"). The App is designed to measure and analyze vehicle performance metrics — including acceleration times (e.g., 0–60 mph, 0–100 mph), quarter-mile and half-mile times, and other driving performance data. It may also include drive tracking and historical performance features.

By downloading, accessing, or using the App, you ("User," "you," or "your") agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree to these Terms, please do not access or use the App.

ELIGIBILITY

You must be at least 18 years old (or the age of legal majority in your jurisdiction) and capable of entering into a binding contract to use the App. By using the App, you confirm that you meet these requirements.

USER RESPONSIBILITIES

You agree to use FastTrack Rides only for lawful and responsible purposes and in compliance with all applicable vehicle, traffic, and safety laws. Specifically:

• You must not operate the App in a way that distracts you or impairs your ability to drive safely.

• You should only conduct performance testing in controlled, safe, and legal environments such as closed tracks or private roads.

• You acknowledge that all driving and testing activities are undertaken at your own risk.

• Data and speed measurements provided by FastTrack Rides are for informational and entertainment purposes only and are not guaranteed to be precise for professional or legal use.

• You are solely responsible for ensuring that your vehicle is in a safe and appropriate condition for testing.

• Failure to follow applicable laws or safety guidelines may result in suspension or termination of your access to the App.

LIABILITY DISCLAIMER

IMPORTANT: PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY.

To the fullest extent permitted by law, FastTrack Rides, Inc., its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents, and licensors will not be liable for any losses, damages, injuries, claims, or expenses — whether direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or punitive — arising out of or in connection with:

• The use, misuse, or inability to use the App;

• Any accident, traffic violation, property damage, injury, or death occurring while using or as a result of using the App;

• Any reliance on or use of the App's data, including speed, acceleration, or performance metrics; or

• Errors, inaccuracies, or technical issues within the App.

You acknowledge that performance testing inherently involves risk, including potential damage to property and personal injury. By using FastTrack Rides, you expressly agree to release, waive, and hold harmless the Company from any and all liability arising from or related to your use of the App.

Some jurisdictions may not allow the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages. In those cases, FastTrack Rides' liability will be limited to the maximum extent permitted by law.

INDEMNIFICATION

You agree to indemnify and hold harmless FastTrack Rides, Inc., its affiliates, officers, employees, licensors, and agents from and against any and all losses, damages, claims, liabilities, expenses, or costs (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or related to:

• Your use or misuse of the App;

• Your violation of these Terms; or

• Your violation of any law, regulation, or third-party right.

This obligation will survive the termination of these Terms and your use of the App.
